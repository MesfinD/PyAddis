We highly recommend installing Jekyll on your computer to preview your site and help diagnose troubled builds before publishing your site on GitHub Pages.

Luckily, installing Jekyll on your computer, and ensuring your computer most closely matches the GitHub Pages settings is easy, thanks to the GitHub Pages Gem and our dependency versions page. To install Jekyll, you'll need a few things:

Ruby - Jekyll requires the Ruby language. If you have a Mac, you've most likely already got Ruby. If you open up the Terminal application, and run the command ruby --version you can confirm this. Your Ruby version should be at least 2.0.0. If you've got that, you're all set. Skip to step #2. Otherwise, follow these instructions to install Ruby.
