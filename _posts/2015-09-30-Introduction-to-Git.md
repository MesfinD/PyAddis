Git! [Git!](https://git-scm.com/) Git! Learn more about version control, Git, and a little about [GitHub](https://github.com/) at this session being led by [Alexey Shiklomanov](https://github.com/ashiklom). Join us in Stone Science 442 at 3:00 on 9/30. 

This session is open to beginners and everyone is welcome to attend. We will be using the command-line interface for some of this session. If you're unfamiliar with the command line, you might want to check out [Lifehacker's primer](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) - the first half of the article is probably enough. 

Want to get started with GitHub before the event? Checkout GitHub's ["Set Up Git"](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) or [download a desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/).
