Our next session will be on installing and using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Led by Chris Holden this session will cover what [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is, how to install it, and how to use it. Join us October 22, 2015 in STO 442 from 5:00-6:00. 

If you're interested in coding in Python, R, Ruby, or any of the other 40 languages supported by [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - you'll want to attend this event. And beginners are welcome!
