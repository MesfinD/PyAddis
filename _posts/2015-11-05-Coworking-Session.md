Hi Everyone! Stop in to [STO 442 on November 5 from 5-7](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/12) for a coworking session. Coworking sessions are a great opportunity to get some work done in an informal, collaborative atmosphere. 

Also, if you have any questions from one of our previous sessions - a coworking session is the time to get a little additional help.
