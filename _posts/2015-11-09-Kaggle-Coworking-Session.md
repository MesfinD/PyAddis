Hi Everyone! Stop in to [STO 442 on November 9 from 5-7](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/17) for a coworking session focused on [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). Coworking sessions are a great opportunity to get some work done in an informal, collaborative atmosphere. 

Also, if you have any questions from one of our previous sessions - a coworking session is the time to get a little additional help.
