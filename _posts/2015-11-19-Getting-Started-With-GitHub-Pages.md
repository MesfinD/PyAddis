Interested in creating your own website to showcase your work? Boom! [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Attend our '[Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/16)' session on November 19, 2015 in STO 442 to learn all about this great service from GitHub. 

Everyone is welcome! But, if you have never used GitHub before, [sign up for an account beforehand](https://github.com/). Lastly, if you're interested in setting up a blog - check out [Jekyll before the session too](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Hope to see you there!
