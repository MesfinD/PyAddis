[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) allows you to create and share reproducible development environments. This is a great solution for those "well, it works on my machine" problems. Everyone is welcome to this introduction to Vagrant session. Chris will be leading this session in STO 442 from 5:00 - 7:00.
