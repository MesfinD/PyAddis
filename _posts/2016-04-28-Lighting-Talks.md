We are organizing a [Lighting Talk session](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/41) for April 28, 2016 from 5:00-7:00. The location is tentatively set for STO 442. 

Lighting Talks are an easy way to showcase your work and since they are only 5-8 minutes, the preparation time is minimal. If you're presenting at an upcoming conference or have a final presentation, giving a Lighting Talk is the prefect opportunity to do a test run in a relaxed atmosphere. 

If you're [interested in presenting, add a comment to the issue in our GitHub repository with a one sentence blurb](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/41) and we will add you to the agenda.
