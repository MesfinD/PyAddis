We are currently developing our plan for the summer. If [you're interested in helping, presenting, or leading](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/44) let us know! Our current plan is to run four Software Carpentry inspired sessions during May followed by a series of brown bag lunches on Unix / Bash.
