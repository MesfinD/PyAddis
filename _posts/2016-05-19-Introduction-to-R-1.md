Inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) this session is designed to help new programmers and coders to become more familiar with [R. R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a common, open source language for doing statistical computing. It is great for working with large data sets and doing basic graphing. 

If you've ever wanted to start learning R. This workshop is for you! 

Time: 1-4 
Location: CAS 435/435B 

After the session, we'll head to the BU Pub for a "Hacky Hour."
