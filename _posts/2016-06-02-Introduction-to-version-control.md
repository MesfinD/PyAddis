Inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) this session is designed to help new programmers and coders to become more familiar with [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) using [git](https://git-scm.com/). Using version control can help you collaborate, better track your work, and greatly facilitates documenting your work. 

If you've ever wanted to start using version control. This workshop is for you! 

Time: 1-4 
Location: CAS 435/435B 

After the session, we'll head to the BU Pub for a "Hacky Hour."
