Inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) this session is designed to help new programmers and coders to become more familiar with [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and using the [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29). [Will Kearney](https://github.com/wkearn) will be leading us through navigating files and directories, creating things, and pipes and filters.

If you've ever wanted an introduction to Unix commands and using the shell. This workshop is for you!

Time: 1-4 
Location: CAS 132

After the session, we'll head to the BU Pub for a "Hacky Hour."
