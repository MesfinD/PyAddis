Inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) this session is designed to help new programmers and coders learn [R. R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a common, open source language for doing statistical computing. It is great for working with large data sets and doing basic data visualizations. 

If you've ever wanted to start learning R. This workshop is for you!
