Inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) this session is designed to help new programmers and coders learn [R. R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a common, open source language for doing statistical computing. It is great for working with large data sets and doing basic data visualizations.
