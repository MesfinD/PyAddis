There is no better summer activity then [learning LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)! LaTeX is great for writing elegant and clean documents. It is a "high-quality typesetting system" designed for technical and scientific writing. If you've ever read a great looking article with beautiful equations and tables, it was probably written in LaTeX. 

Join us for this [Introduction to LaTeX session on Thursday, July 28 from 1:00-3:00 in STO 442](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/56). **Bring your CV!** We'll be demonstrating how to write a CV in LaTeX.
