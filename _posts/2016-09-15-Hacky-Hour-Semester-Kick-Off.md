Help start the new semester with us at our semester kickoff event (or hacky hour aka social event). We'll be meeting in Biology Graduate Student Lounge, which is room 117 in the [Biology Research Building (BRB 117)](http://www.bu.edu/maps/index.php?id=716), from 6:00-7:30. Some food and beverages will be provided.
