Join us for a session on using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). Pandoc is a great tool for reformatting text. It allows you to create LaTeX, slide shows, html, and much more from simple markdown.

This session will be from **6:00-7:30 in the Estin Room** ([labeled interlibrary loan on this map](http://study.bu.edu/img/BU_lib_floorplans_mugar_fin5-03.png)). Which is on the 3rd floor of Mugar library.
