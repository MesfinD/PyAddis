Our next session will be on installing and using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). This session will cover what [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks are, how to install and run Jupyter, and how to use it. Join us at 6:00 in the Estin Room (room 302) of Mugar Library.  

If you're interested in coding in Python, R, Ruby, or any of the other 40 languages supported by [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - you'll want to attend this event. And beginners are welcome!
