This week we will be covering [RESTful APIs](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/67), how to access them, and the common data types they return. RESTful APIs are great for gathering existing datasets for your research. [Joshua Klein](https://github.com/mobiusklein) and [Betsy Cowdery](https://github.com/bcow) will be leading the discussion. 

Join us in the Estin Room (Mugar Library - Room 302) at 6:00.
