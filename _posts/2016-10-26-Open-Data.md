In honor of Open Access Week we'll be covering [Mozilla's Open Data Training](https://github.com/mozillascience/open-data-training). If you're interested in learning more about how to make your data open, this session is for you. We'll cover the principles of open data and review a data reuse plan. [Tom Hohenstein](https://github.com/tomhohenstein) will be leading this session. 

Join us in the Estin Room (Mugar Library room 302) at 6:00.
