Stop in to the Estin Room [(Mugar Library room 302) on Feb 8. from 6:30-8:00](https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/72) for a coworking and planning session. Coworking sessions are a great opportunity to get some work done in an informal, collaborative atmosphere. We will also be planning our upcoming events and workshops. If you're interested in leading a session or have workshop idea - like a [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/) - please let us know!
