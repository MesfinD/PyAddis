Inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) this session is designed to help new programmers and coders become more familiar with [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and using the [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29). [Mesfin Diro](https://github.com/mesfind) will be leading us through navigating files, making directories, creating files, using pipes, and making filters.

If you've ever wanted an introduction to Unix commands and data anlysis using Python. This workshop is for you!
