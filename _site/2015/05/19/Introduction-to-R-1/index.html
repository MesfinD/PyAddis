<p>Inspired by <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">Software Carpentry</a> this session is designed to help new programmers and coders to become more familiar with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R. R</a> is a common, open source language for doing statistical computing. It is great for working with large data sets and doing basic graphing. </p>

<p>If you’ve ever wanted to start learning R. This workshop is for you! </p>

<p>Time: 1-4 
Location: CAS 435/435B </p>

<p>After the session, we’ll head to the BU Pub for a “Hacky Hour.” </p>
