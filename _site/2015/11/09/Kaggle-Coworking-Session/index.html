<p>Hi Everyone! Stop in to <a href="https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/17">STO 442 on November 9 from 5-7</a> for a coworking session focused on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle Competitions</a>. Coworking sessions are a great opportunity to get some work done in an informal, collaborative atmosphere. </p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions from one of our previous sessions - a coworking session is the time to get a little additional help.  </p>
