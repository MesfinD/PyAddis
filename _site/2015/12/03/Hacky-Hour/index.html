<p>Hi Everyone, </p>

<p>We are planning and organizing a <a href="https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/18">Lightning Talk session</a> for December 3, 2015 from 5:00-6:30. The location is tentatively set for STO 442. </p>

<p>Lightning Talks are an easy way to showcase your work and since they are only 5-8 minutes, the preparation time is minimal. If you’re presenting at an upcoming conference or have a final presentation, giving a Lighting Talk is the prefect opportunity to do a test run in a relaxed atmosphere. </p>

<p>If you’re <a href="https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/18">interested in presenting, add a comment to the issue in our GitHub repository with a one sentence blurb</a> and we will add you to the agenda. </p>
