<p>This session is an opportunity for the BU MATLAB programming community to come together to discuss, and hopefully resolve, programming issues we have encountered in our work. All levels of MATLAB experience from any academic area are welcome, and no issue is too small or too big. Keith Ma will lead a group discussion of one issue at a time, and have a projector and laptop for hands-on programming. You can join in with us, or if you prefer, work together in small groups. Keith will be taking the lead and weâ€™ll be meeting in MCS 148 from 5:00-6:30. </p>
