<p>We are currently developing our plan for the summer. If <a href="https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/44">youâ€™re interested in helping, presenting, or leading</a> let us know! Our current plan is to run four Software Carpentry inspired sessions during May followed by a series of brown bag lunches on Unix / Bash. </p>
