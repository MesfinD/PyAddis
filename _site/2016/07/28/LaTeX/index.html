<p>There is no better summer activity then <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">learning LaTeX</a>! LaTeX is great for writing elegant and clean documents. It is a “high-quality typesetting system” designed for technical and scientific writing. If you’ve ever read a great looking article with beautiful equations and tables, it was probably written in LaTeX. </p>
