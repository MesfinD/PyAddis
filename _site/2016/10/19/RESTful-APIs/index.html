<p>This week we will be covering <a href="https://github.com/bulib/studyGroup/issues/67">RESTful APIs</a>, how to access them, and the common data types they return. RESTful APIs are great for gathering existing datasets for your research. <a href="https://github.com/mobiusklein">Joshua Klein</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bcow">Betsy Cowdery</a> will be leading the discussion. </p>

<p>Join us in the Estin Room (Mugar Library - Room 302) at 6:00. </p>
