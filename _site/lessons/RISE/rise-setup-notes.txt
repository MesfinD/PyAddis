1. Install (download and unzip) "RISE" from https://github.com/damianavila/RISE
   - note that I have a git clone so only need to git pull

2. In RISE directory, run the setup: "python setup.py install"
    This creates a copy of reveal.js in the ipython customization directory ~/.ipython
    By default, this installs into the default python profile: ~/.ipython/profile_default

3. To modify slideshow theme and transition to my liking (can edit this):
   ipython configureRISE.py.  However not everything can be configured
   yet through the configuration manager, so you may want to edit the
   config parameters directly.  

   These are in ~/.jupyter/nbconfig/livereveal.json

Mine looks like this:

{
  "theme": "beige", 
  "transition": "fade", 
  "leap_motion": {
    "pointerOpacity": 0.5, 
    "pointerColor": "#d80000", 
    "naturalSwipe": true
  }, 
    "start_slideshow_at": "selected",
    "scroll" : true
}

3.5:  To make style edits to livereveal overall, edit
      in jupyter/ipython 4 this is now ~/Library/Jupyter/nbextensions/livereveal/main.css
      For example,
      	  * set the main 160% font scaling factor to 100% (for smaller
	        room, ie, teaching)
	 * set the codeMirror font size to 140% to make it larger and
      clearer
         * set the output from the interpreter to be larger
eg:

.reveal .slides {
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 100%; /* MEC changed */
}

div.output_subarea {
    margin-top: 0.05em;
    font-size: 140%;   /* MEC added */
}
.CodeMirror {
  font-size: 140%;  /* MEC added */
  max-width: 960px !important;  /* fix for firefox issue in IPython, 1240px */
}

3.6: More config possibilities in livereveal/main.js
     eg, remove controls in lower right

3.7: Add a QT console button so that figures can be manipulated, etc,
outside of the notebook.   This is done by editing ~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js

4. Running:  jupyter notebook

5. To create slides, turn on the "cell toolbar" and set to slideshow
    Using the toolbar, mark cells as "slides" or "fragments" (which are displayed on keyclick)
    To use "subslide" need to use command-downarrow (pagedown)

6. option-R (or slideshow button upper right) flips between normal and slideshow
     capital-F to go to fullscreen
