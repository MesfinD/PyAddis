# Lessons Folder 

Welcome to our Lessons Folder. And a big thank you for sharing your work. Please, use this space to develop lessons and to share them with the wider community. 

To start a new lesson
- create a new folder 
- add a README.md file based on the [template](template/lesson.md)
- write your lesson 

## From Mozilla's Handbook

1. **Keep it short.** An hour is plenty long enough; more than this, and it becomes too much to absorb all at once.
2. **Keep it simple.** That hour will go by really fast for the demo leader - sixty minutes is really only enough time to cover a few introductory ideas. Remember, there's no final exam; if people walk away with a successful first couple of steps on the topic, that's all they need to get started and learn more in future.
3. **Keep beginners on board.** This means explicitly illustrating every step, and going slow enough for participants to copy down everything you're doing - so that everyone can follow along.
4. **No slides.** Slides are boring. The presenter should live-demo all their examples, while everyone else follows along on their own machines.
5. **Give people challenge problems.** If you're the presenter, don't talk the whole time - take a couple of breaks to let your students try their new skills on a challenge problem or mini-project. This also gives you the chance to answer questions, and make sure no one gets lost.
6. **Keep it real.** Try and illustrate how you actually use the tool in your research; this way, everyone will understand not only how to use it, but why it's valuable in real practice.
7. **Encourage non-experts to lead.** It is absolutely not required to know everything about a package or skill to lead a demo on it. Always invite participants to lead a future session, and remind them that it's more interesting and more authentic to see how they use the tool in question, than to see a more esoteric perspective.
8. **Post the lesson notes.** It takes some work to prepare the notes for a lesson - instead of letting them disappear afterwards, put them here.
