# Getting Started with Jekyll 

This lesson's intent is to help you get started using Jekyll to post materials to GitHub Pages. 

## What is Jekyll? 

From [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/): 

```
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. 
It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, 
runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, 
and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for 
serving with your favorite web server. 
```

What's that mean? You can use Jekyll to create a static blog for free using GitHub Pages. 

## Why use Jekyll? 

Jekyll allows you to write posts and pages in Markdown and other text formats - like HTML or Liquid. 
So rather than writing <p> tages and <a> tags, you can write in Markdown and let 
Jekyll do the markup. 


## What are the prerequisites? 

 1. Ruby
 2. RubyGems
 3. Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X
 4. NodeJS (or another JavaScript runtime) 
 5. Python 2.7 (for Jekyll 2 and earlier)
